# Common_Functions
Includes commonly used functions written by me

Open to all, they functions here are not advanced proprietary functions (you probably can write them yourself), they are common operations that you'd use in various projects and programs.

The functions here are written in C.

Version 1.0:
    -Includes several fucntions for linked lists and stacks.
    -Includes a few functions that can be used in crypto programs (they are not the most secure functions, but can be used for learning).
    
P.S.: Please use these functions IF AND ONLY IF you are familiar with these concepts. These functions are merely a backup of the stuff I've written, for me to use in the future, but I'm opening them up to the public. Please do not use these functions for academic purposes if you do not understand any of the used concepts and techniques.

Written and compiled by,
Ashwin Natarajan
