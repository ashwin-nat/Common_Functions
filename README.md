# Common_Functions
Includes commonly used functions written by me

Open to all, they functions here are not advanced proprietary functions (you probably can write them yourself), they are common operations that you'd use in various projects and programs.

The functions here are written in C.

Version 1.0:
    -Includes several fucntions for linked lists and stacks.
    -Includes a few functions that can be used in crypto programs (they are not the most secure functions, but can be used for learning).
